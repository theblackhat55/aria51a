Risk Score = Probability × Impact × Context Multiplier + AI Enhancement
```

**Risk Severity Classifications:**
- **Critical (90-100)**: 🔴 Immediate action (0-24h)
- **High (70-89)**: 🟠 Urgent action (1-7 days)  
- **Medium (40-69)**: 🟡 Scheduled action (1-30 days)
- **Low (1-39)**: 🟢 Routine monitoring
