# Enhanced Risk Form with AI and Dynamic Risk Scoring

## Overview

The enhanced risk form combines the best features from v1 and v2, adding powerful new capabilities:

1. **AI-Powered Risk Analysis** - Uses Cloudflare AI (Llama 3.1 8B) to analyze risks and provide recommendations
2. **Service & Asset Linking** - Links risks to services and assets following RMF hierarchy
3. **Dynamic Risk Scoring** - Automatically adjusts risk scores based on service/asset criticality
4. **Clean Architecture** - Maintains v2's clean separation of concerns

## What Was Created

### 1. Database Schema (Migration 0115)

**New Tables:**
- `services` - Business services, IT systems, applications
  - Criticality scoring (1-5 scale)
  - Business impact requirements (availability, confidentiality, integrity)
  - Financial impact metrics (revenue impact, downtime cost)
  - Compliance information
  - SLA metrics (uptime, RTO, RPO)

- `service_assets` - Links services to assets (many-to-many)
- `risk_services` - Links risks to services (many-to-many)
- `vulnerabilities` - Tracks security vulnerabilities

**RMF Hierarchy:**
```
Risks → Services → Assets → Incidents/Vulnerabilities
```

**Sample Services Data:**
- 8 sample services seeded (Customer Portal, Payment Processing, CRM, etc.)
- Range from Critical (5) to Low (2) criticality scores

**Triggers for Dynamic Updates:**
- When service criticality changes → Update linked risks
- When risk-service linking changes → Update risk
- When service-asset linking changes → Update service and related risks

### 2. Enhanced Risk Form Template

**File:** `src/modules/risk/presentation/templates/riskFormsEnhanced.ts`

**Key Features:**

1. **AI Analysis Section**
   - Quick input fields for AI analysis (title, description, category)
   - "Analyze with AI" button triggers Cloudflare AI
   - Displays detailed analysis with structured recommendations
   - "Auto-Fill Form" button populates form fields with AI suggestions

2. **Service & Asset Linking**
   - Multi-select dropdown for services
   - Dynamic asset filtering based on selected services
   - Visual indicators showing criticality levels
   - Real-time HTMX updates

3. **Dynamic Risk Assessment**
   - Base probability and impact inputs
   - Automatic score calculation with service criticality adjustments
   - Shows both base score and adjusted score
   - Color-coded risk levels (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

4. **Enhanced UX**
   - Numbered sections with icons
   - Gradient color scheme (blue-purple)
   - Real-time field synchronization
   - Comprehensive form validation

### 3. API Endpoints

**File:** `src/modules/risk/presentation/routes/riskUIRoutes.ts`

**New Endpoints:**

1. **GET `/risk-v2/ui/create-enhanced`**
   - Returns enhanced risk creation modal

2. **POST `/risk-v2/ui/analyze-ai`**
   - Analyzes risk using Cloudflare AI
   - Returns structured analysis with probability, impact, mitigation actions
   - Uses Llama 3.1 8B model

3. **GET `/risk-v2/ui/services`**
   - Returns active services for selection
   - Ordered by criticality score (high to low)

4. **GET `/risk-v2/ui/assets-by-services`**
   - Returns assets filtered by selected services
   - Dynamic filtering based on service-asset relationships

5. **POST `/risk-v2/ui/calculate-dynamic-score`**
   - Calculates risk score with service criticality adjustments
   - Adjustment formula: `1.0 + (avg_criticality - 3) * 0.15`
   - Returns base score, adjusted score, and adjustment factor

**Adjustment Examples:**
- Critical services (5): 1.30x multiplier
- High services (4): 1.15x multiplier
- Medium services (3): 1.00x (no adjustment)
- Low services (2): 0.85x multiplier
- Minimal services (1): 0.70x multiplier

## How It Works

### User Workflow

1. **Open Enhanced Form**
   - Click "Add Risk" button (now shows "AI Enhanced" badge)
   - Enhanced modal opens with all sections visible

2. **AI Analysis (Optional)**
   - Enter title, description, category in quick input fields
   - Click "Analyze with AI"
   - AI analyzes the risk and provides:
     - Detailed assessment summary
     - Key risk factors
     - Business impact analysis
     - Recommended mitigation actions
     - Probability and impact scores (1-5)
     - Suggested review dates

3. **Auto-Fill with AI Data**
   - Click "Auto-Fill Form" button
   - Form fields automatically populated with AI recommendations:
     - Probability score
     - Impact score
     - Mitigation plan
     - Review date
   - User can review and adjust as needed

4. **Link Services and Assets**
   - Select one or more services from dropdown
   - Assets dropdown automatically filters to show only assets used by selected services
   - Real-time HTMX updates

5. **Dynamic Risk Scoring**
   - Enter or adjust probability and impact
   - Risk score automatically calculates with service criticality adjustments
   - Display shows:
     - Base score (probability × impact)
     - Adjustment factor (based on service criticality)
     - Final adjusted score
     - Risk level (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

6. **Complete and Submit**
   - Fill in ownership, mitigation plans, tags
   - Submit form to create risk with all relationships

### Technical Flow

```
1. User clicks "Analyze with AI"
   ↓
2. HTMX POST to /risk-v2/ui/analyze-ai
   ↓
3. Server calls Cloudflare AI (Llama 3.1 8B)
   ↓
4. AI returns structured analysis
   ↓
5. Server parses analysis and renders result HTML
   ↓
6. HTMX swaps result into #ai-analysis-result
   ↓
7. User clicks "Auto-Fill Form"
   ↓
8. JavaScript extracts AI data and fills form fields
   ↓
9. Probability/Impact change triggers risk score calculation
   ↓
10. HTMX POST to /risk-v2/ui/calculate-dynamic-score
    ↓
11. Server calculates with service criticality adjustments
    ↓
12. HTMX swaps new score display
```

## Dynamic Risk Recalculation

### Automatic Updates

When underlying services or assets change criticality, risks are automatically updated via database triggers:

```sql
-- When service criticality changes
CREATE TRIGGER update_risks_on_service_criticality_change
AFTER UPDATE OF criticality_score ON services
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
  UPDATE risks 
  SET updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  WHERE id IN (
    SELECT risk_id 
    FROM risk_services 
    WHERE service_id = NEW.id
  );
END;
```

### Future Enhancement: Scheduled Recalculation

To fully implement dynamic risk recalculation based on new data:

1. **Background Job** (via Cloudflare Cron Triggers)
   - Runs daily/weekly
   - Recalculates all risk scores based on current service/asset criticality
   - Updates risk_score field in database

2. **Manual Recalculation**
   - Admin button to trigger recalculation
   - API endpoint: `POST /risk-v2/api/recalculate-all-risks`

3. **Real-Time Recalculation**
   - When service criticality changes
   - When asset is reclassified
   - When service-asset relationships change

## Database Statistics

```sql
-- Check services
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM services; -- Should show 8 services

-- Check service criticality distribution
SELECT criticality, COUNT(*) as count 
FROM services 
GROUP BY criticality;

-- View RMF hierarchy
SELECT * FROM v_rmf_hierarchy LIMIT 10;

-- View service criticality summary
SELECT * FROM v_service_criticality_summary;
```

## Conclusion

The enhanced risk form successfully combines:
- **AI automation** from v1
