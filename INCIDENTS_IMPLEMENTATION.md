# Incidents Management Implementation

## Overview
Added comprehensive Incident Management functionality to the ARIA5 Operations section, accessible through the navigation menu.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created New Incident Routes (`src/routes/incidents-routes.ts`)
Implemented three main incident management pages:

#### **Active Incidents** (`/incidents`)
- **Dashboard with real-time statistics:**
  - Open Incidents count
  - In Progress incidents
  - Today's incidents
  - Resolved incidents count
- **Interactive incidents table** with:
  - Incident title and description
  - Severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  - Status tracking (Open, In Progress, Resolved, Closed)
  - Source identification (Manual, Defender, ServiceNow, etc.)
  - Assignment tracking
  - Creation timestamps
  - Quick action buttons (View, Edit)
- **Quick Actions panel:**
  - Create new incident
  - Navigate to Security Events
  - Navigate to Response Actions
- **Search functionality** for filtering incidents

#### **Security Events** (`/incidents/security-events`)
- Event correlation from SIEM & EDR systems
- Microsoft Defender for Endpoint integration status
- Real-time event monitoring dashboard
- Ready for integration with security event feeds

#### **Response Actions** (`/incidents/response-actions`)
- Track remediation tasks and playbooks
- **Active metrics:**
  - Active playbooks count
  - Pending tasks
  - Completed today statistics
- Response action queue management
- Automated playbook execution tracking

### 2. API Endpoints Created

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/incidents/api/incidents` | GET | List all incidents (50 most recent) |
| `/incidents/api/incidents/:id` | GET | Get specific incident details |
| `/incidents/api/incidents` | POST | Create new incident |
| `/incidents/api/incidents/:id` | PUT | Update incident |

### 3. Database Integration
Connected to existing `incidents` table in D1 database with fields:
- `id`, `title`, `description`
- `severity` (critical, high, medium, low)
- `status` (open, in_progress, resolved, closed)
- `category`, `source`
- `assigned_to`, `created_by`
- `created_at`, `updated_at`

### 4. Navigation Integration
Incidents menu items are already integrated in both:
- **Desktop navigation** (Operations dropdown)
- **Mobile navigation** (Operations section)

Three sub-pages accessible:
1. **Active Incidents** - Main incident dashboard
2. **Security Events** - SIEM/EDR event correlation
3. **Response Actions** - Remediation and playbook tracking

### 5. Route Mounting
- Added route import in `src/index-secure.ts`
- Mounted route at `/incidents` with authentication middleware
- Protected by session authentication (requires login)

## Technical Details

### Technologies Used
- **Backend Framework:** Hono (Cloudflare Workers)
- **Database:** Cloudflare D1 (SQLite)
- **Frontend:** HTMX + TailwindCSS + FontAwesome
- **Authentication:** JWT-based session middleware
- **API Design:** RESTful with JSON responses

### Security
- âœ… Authentication required for all incident routes
- âœ… CSRF protection on state-changing operations
- âœ… Role-based access control ready
- âœ… Secure headers configured
- âœ… SQL injection protection (prepared statements)

### Performance
- Efficient database queries (indexed by created_at)
- Limit of 50 incidents per page (pagination ready)
- Lazy loading of incident details
- Optimized for edge deployment (Cloudflare Workers)

## Access Information

### Production URL
```
https://1942819f.aria51a.pages.dev/incidents
```

### Development URL
```
https://3000-idmf47b821gs003xe0l0a-6532622b.e2b.dev/incidents
```

### Navigation Path
```
Dashboard â†’ Operations (dropdown) â†’ Active Incidents
```

## Testing

### Test the API
```bash
# Get all incidents
curl https://your-domain.pages.dev/incidents/api/incidents

# Get specific incident
curl https://your-domain.pages.dev/incidents/api/incidents/1

# Create incident (requires authentication)
curl -X POST https://your-domain.pages.dev/incidents/api/incidents \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "Security Alert: Suspicious Login",
    "description": "Multiple failed login attempts detected",
    "severity": "high",
    "status": "open",
    "category": "security",
    "source": "defender"
  }'
```

## Database Schema Reference

```sql
CREATE TABLE incidents (
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT,
  severity TEXT DEFAULT 'medium',
  status TEXT DEFAULT 'open',
  category TEXT,
  source TEXT,
  assigned_to INTEGER,
  created_by INTEGER,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE INDEX idx_incidents_status ON incidents(status);
CREATE INDEX idx_incidents_created_at ON incidents(created_at DESC);
```

## Git Commit
```
Commit: e2263cd
Message: Add Incidents Management routes under Operations section
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy to Production:**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy:prod
   ```

2. **Seed Test Data:**
   Create sample incidents for testing:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO incidents (title, description, severity, status, source) VALUES
   ('Malware Detection', 'Trojan detected on workstation WS-001', 'critical', 'open', 'defender'),
   ('Phishing Attempt', 'Suspicious email reported by user', 'high', 'in_progress', 'email_gateway'),
   ('Failed Login Attempts', '50+ failed login attempts from external IP', 'medium', 'resolved', 'siem');
   ```

3. **Enable Microsoft Defender Integration:**
   - Configure API credentials in Integration Marketplace
   - Set up webhook for real-time incident sync
   - Enable automatic incident creation from Defender alerts

4. **Configure Automated Playbooks:**
   - Define response workflows
   - Set up notification rules
   - Configure escalation matrix
