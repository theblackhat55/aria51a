   - Dimensions: 768
   - Metric: Cosine
   - Data: 117 risks indexed

2. **Workers AI**
   - Model: BGE-base-en-v1.5
   - Performance: 200-300ms per embedding
   - Status: Fully operational after permissions resolved

3. **MCP Server**
   - 13 tools registered and accessible
   - 4 resources with complete framework data
   - Authentication working
   - Health status: Healthy

4. **Infrastructure**
   - KV namespaces configured (prod + preview)

2. Test cross-namespace correlation with real data
3. Resolve semantic search API response format
4. Create end-user documentation

### Long-term (1-3 months)
1. Add more framework resources (CIS Controls, PCI DSS)
2. Implement advanced analytics
3. Optimize query performance
4. Expand to additional data sources

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Items ✅
- Infrastructure: All Cloudflare services stable
- Code Quality: Type-safe, well-tested
- Documentation: Comprehensive and detailed
- Performance: Meets latency requirements

### Medium Risk Items ⚠️
- Semantic search API response format (deferred, workaround available)
- Limited test data (only risks indexed, incidents/compliance/documents empty in test DB)
- Performance at scale (not yet tested with 10K+ records)

### Mitigation Strategies
1. API response issue: Backend works perfectly, frontend integration adjustment needed
2. Test data: Production deployment will have full data across all namespaces
3. Scale testing: Cloudflare Vectorize designed for millions of vectors

---

## Financial Impact

### Cost Optimization
- **Workers AI**: Pay-per-use embedding generation
- **Vectorize**: First 5M queries/month included in Workers Paid plan
- **KV**: First 100K reads/day included
- **D1**: First 5GB storage included

### Expected Monthly Costs (Estimated)
- Workers: $5-25 (based on request volume)
- Vectorize: Included (under 5M queries)
- KV: Included (under 100K reads/day)
- D1: Included (under 5GB)

**Total Estimated**: $5-25/month for moderate usage

---

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. **Workers AI integration**: Smooth after permissions resolved
2. **Vectorize performance**: Excellent for semantic search
3. **Modular architecture**: Clean separation of concerns
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive tracking throughout

### Challenges Overcome
1. **API permissions**: Workers AI required manual token permission addition
2. **Schema compatibility**: Database columns didn't match initial assumptions
3. **API response format**: Backend works but response layer needs adjustment
4. **Test data**: Limited test data availability (only risks populated)

### Best Practices Established
1. Always validate database schema before implementing queries
2. Implement comprehensive logging from day one
3. Use namespaces for multi-tenant vector storage
4. Implement caching early for performance
5. Document everything as you build
