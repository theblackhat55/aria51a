**Date**: 2025-10-23  
**Duration**: ~2.5 hours  
**Status**: 🎉 **ALL TASKS COMPLETED**

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### Task 1: Add risk_id Field Migration ✅
**Time**: 30 minutes  
**Status**: Completed

- Created migration file: `migrations/0114_add_risk_id_field.sql`
- Added `risk_id TEXT UNIQUE` column to risks table
- Created unique index on risk_id field
- Updated seed data to include risk_id values (RISK-00001 through RISK-00017)
- Applied migration to local database
- Verified all 17 risks have proper risk IDs

**Database Verification**:
```sql
SELECT id, risk_id, title FROM risks LIMIT 3;
-- ✓ RISK-00001, RISK-00002, RISK-00003
```

---

### Task 2: Fix Owner Name Lookup ✅
**Time**: 45 minutes  
**Status**: Completed

- Created helper function `getOwnerName()` in `riskUIRoutes.ts`
- Updated all UI routes to fetch owner names from users table:
  - Risk table (with batch query optimization)
  - View modal
  - Edit modal
  - Status change modal
- Owner names now display as "FirstName LastName" instead of "Unassigned"
- Removed all TODO comments related to owner lookup

**Code Changes**:
- Added `getOwnerName()` helper function
- Updated 4 route handlers
- Efficient batch query for table list (single query for all owners)
- Individual queries for modals (acceptable for single-item access)

---

## 🎯 Outcomes

### All Issues Fixed
1. ✅ risk_id field added to database and seed data
2. ✅ Owner names now display correctly (not "Unassigned")
3. ✅ Import functionality verified (was already working)
4. ✅ Export functionality verified (was already working)

### No Remaining Known Issues
All items from the "Known Issues" list have been resolved:
- ❌ ~~Owner name lookup~~ → ✅ Fixed
- ❌ ~~Import/Export placeholders~~ → ✅ Already implemented
- ❌ ~~Missing risk_id field~~ → ✅ Fixed

### Minor Issues (Deferred)
Two low-priority items remain but don't block testing:
1. **Pagination Integration** - Component exists but not wired to filters (fine for 17 risks)
2. **Event Bus Integration** - Domain events not emitted (non-blocking)

---

## 📊 Current Status

### Database
- **Tables**: All complete with proper schema
- **Migrations**: 3/3 applied (including new risk_id)
- **Seed Data**: 3 orgs, 10 users, 17 risks
- **risk_id Field**: ✅ Present and populated (RISK-00001 to RISK-00017)

### Code Quality
- **TODO Comments**: Removed from riskUIRoutes.ts
- **Owner Lookup**: Implemented across all routes
- **Import/Export**: Fully functional
- **Git**: All changes committed

### Service
- **PM2 Status**: Online (aria51a process)
- **Health Check**: Passing
- **Public URL**: Active
- **Database**: Connected (aria51a-production)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
1. Open https://3000-idmf47b821gs003xe0l0a-6532622b.e2b.dev/login
2. Login with: `riskmanager` / `demo123`
3. Navigate to Risk v2: `/risk-v2/ui/`
4. Verify:
   - ✅ Table shows all 17 risks
   - ✅ risk_id column shows RISK-00001, etc.
   - ✅ Owner column shows "David Martinez" not "Unassigned"
   - ✅ Statistics cards load
5. Test Create Risk:
   - ✅ Live score calculation works
   - ✅ New risk gets auto-generated risk_id
6. Test Edit Risk:
   - ✅ risk_id field is read-only
   - ✅ Owner name displays correctly
7. Test Import:
   - ✅ Download template works
   - ✅ Upload CSV works
8. Test Export:
   - ✅ CSV download works
   - ✅ risk_id column populated

### Full Test (30 minutes)

## 📈 Time Breakdown

| Task | Estimated | Actual | Status |
|------|-----------|--------|--------|
| risk_id migration | 1 hour | 30 min | ✅ Faster |
| Owner name lookup | 30 min | 45 min | ✅ As expected |
| Import functionality | 4-6 hours | 5 min | ✅ Already done |
| Export functionality | 2-3 hours | 5 min | ✅ Already done |
| Testing & deployment | 1 hour | 45 min | ✅ Complete |
| **TOTAL** | **8-11 hours** | **~2.5 hours** | **✅ Much faster!** |

**Why Faster**: Import/Export were already fully implemented during Days 8-9, saving 6-9 hours!

## 🚀 What's Next?

### Option C: Production Readiness (Recommended)
Now proceed with comprehensive testing:

**Week 3: Days 10-12** (11-15 hours)
- **Day 10**: Side-by-side testing (`/risk/*` vs `/risk-v2/*`)
- **Day 11**: Data migration and compatibility testing  
- **Day 12**: Switchover preparation and documentation

**Testing Suite** (14-18 hours)
- Unit tests for RiskMapper
- Integration tests for D1RiskRepository
- End-to-end HTMX tests
- Performance testing with large datasets

**Total for Production Readiness**: 25-33 hours

### Alternative: Start Using Now
Since all known issues are fixed, you could:
1. Test manually using the checklist
2. Use in development/staging environment
3. Gather user feedback
4. Implement tests based on real usage patterns
